The projects are listed in no particular order:

### Choreflow API -- 2024

I utilised REST principles to design an API that allows users to interact with
a chore management system. I thoroughly documented the API to follow the
OpenAPI Specification standard.

The purpose of this project was to learn how to develop APIs in Go.

### new-cpp-proj -- 2024

I was tired of running `mkdir` and `touch` commands during every lecture, so I
decided to automate the whole process to save time.
The end product was a tool that simplifies

### Todo App -- 2021

This was the first project I built to learn react. In the process, I learned
about the following:

- Javascript promises and asynchronous communications.
- Setting up github actions.
- How to use firebase hosting as well as cloud store database.
- Had my first introduction to bootstrap css.

### Self Reference -- 2021

When I first came into contact with programming, I had no device to practice
with so I ended up writing everything in a notebook. To preserve the contents
in the book, I built self-reference.

There was not much to learn here since it was a basic static website with html,
css, and markdown. Nonetheless, one valuable skill I learned in the process was
how to host websites using firebase.

Some of the services I rendered on codereviewshop included:

- Mentoring
- Pair programming
- Teaching programming languages
- Teaching problem solving
- Teaching how to use software tools like the command line and git.

### Codereviewshop's Blog - 2022

Codereviewshop blog is a subsystem of codereviewshop were I shared my lessons and
advice on my programming journey. It was fun building it using hugo. However, I
migrated all the blog content to my official [substack](https://davesaah.substack.com).

### Hackathon Project: A Portfolio Site -- 2023

This project was my first attempt at participating in a hackathon. It was 6/10
experience because the demands of the project were not clear enough till the
winners were announced.

### Item Check Counter -- 2021

This project arose from a frustration generated by having to wait for a shopkeeper
to go through their notebook to find the item I was purchasing. I developed Item
Check Counter to solve the problem I faced that day. The sad part was, I built the
app on my phone at that time and never showed it to the shopkeeper -- it collected
dust on github since then.
